# AgentEvolve
## Evaluation Framework
### Coding Challenge Dataset
#### Task Categories
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixing and debugging
- Code refactoring
- System design
- Complex data structures
- Asynchronous and concurrent programming
#### Task Specification
**Evolutionary task generation** with adaptive complexity:
- **Context-Aware Prompts**: Historical performance analysis guides challenge difficulty
- **Template Stochasticity**: Randomized variations prevent overfitting to specific formats
- **Progressive Complexity**: Tasks evolve based on agent capability frontier
- **Multi-Objective Constraints**: Requirements, acceptance criteria, performance thresholds
- **Sample I/O Generation**: Dynamic test case creation based on task evolution
- **Success Criteria Adaptation**: Thresholds adjust based on population performance distribution

### Evaluation Metrics
#### Outcome based metrics:
1) Task completeness (instructions and requirements completed)
2) Functional correctness (executable, correct output, proper error handling)
3) Code quality (linting, unit & integration test pass rate, security issues)
4) Structural design (code organization, architecture, patterns, documentation)

#### Process based metrics:
1) Rules following accuracy (followed/ignored/broken)
2) Failure resiliency (self-corrections successful/failed, stuck in loops)
3) Autonomy level (human intervention, decision confidence)
4) Generation efficiency (total LLM calls & tokens used)

#### Extended metrics (optional):
1) Tools usage (shell cmd, cli tools, scripts, web, mcp)
2) Delivery excellence (documentation, language/framework best practices, industry standards)
3) Code quality: static analysis score, complexity measures, unit & integration test coverage
4) Efficiency: time/space complexity, execution time, resource usage

## Analysis Framework
1) Per-category task performance analysis
2) Cross-agent comparison
3) Quadrant chart: Outcome vs. Process performance
4) Strength/weakness identification
5) Failure mode categorization
6) Cost-efficiency analysis (cost vs time vs quality)
7) Ablation studies of agent capabilities

## Continuous Improvement
1) Agent meta-tuning (self-improvement)
2) Distill agent instructions
3) Adjust task difficulty, tool permissions, or scoring weights to ensure discrimination
4) Track agent improvement over time
5) Identify persistent weaknesses
