# AgentEvolve
## Core Architecture

![AgentEvolve Core Architecture](AgentEvolve%20Core%20Architecture.png)

### 1. Evolutionary Controller Pipeline
**Asynchronous orchestration** of agent evaluation cycles with state management:
- **Parent Selection**: Database samples high-performing agent configurations using MAP-Elites + Island Model
- **Context-Aware Task Generation**: Prompt sampler builds evolving coding challenges with historical performance data
- **Multi-Agent Execution**: Parallel agent deployment with isolated execution environments
- **Cascaded Evaluation**: Multi-stage assessment (functional → quality → efficiency) with threshold gating
- **Database Update**: Agent performance stored with feature mapping and elite archive maintenance

### 2. Agent Execution Environment
**Containerized isolation** with evolutionary tracking:
- **Docker-based sandboxes** per agent with resource limits and timeout protection
- **Git branch separation** with agent-specific credentials and workspace isolation
- **Checkpoint system** for resumable evaluations and state recovery
- **Resource monitoring** with computational budget allocation

### 3. Hybrid Evolutionary Database
**Multi-population approach** combining:
- **MAP-Elites Algorithm**: Feature grid mapping for capability diversity maintenance
- **Island Model**: Multi-population evolution for exploration vs exploitation balance
- **Elite Archive**: Best-performing agent configurations preservation
- **Feature Mapping**: Agent capability dimensions (speed, accuracy, code quality, tool usage)

### 4. Multi-Stage Cascade Evaluation
**Progressive assessment** optimizing computational resources:
- **Stage 1**: Fast functional correctness checks with basic metrics
- **Stage 2**: Code quality analysis (linting, testing, security) for threshold-passing solutions
- **Stage 3**: Comprehensive evaluation including efficiency, design patterns, and LLM-based assessment
- **Parallel Execution Pool**: Concurrent evaluation with configurable concurrency limits
