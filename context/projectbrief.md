# AgentEvolve Technical Brief

## System Overview
Evolutionary coding agent built on OpenEvolve framework with multi-model LLM integration. Implements staged evaluation pipeline for code optimization across functional correctness, task completeness, and code quality dimensions.

## Technical Architecture

## Vision & Goals
Create a robust evolutionary coding agent that can:
- Automatically improve code quality through evolutionary algorithms
- Evaluate solutions across functional correctness, task completeness, and code quality metrics
- Provide a development framework for advanced AI-assisted programming

## Core Value Proposition
AgentEvolve bridges the gap between LLM code generation and production-ready software by implementing systematic evolutionary improvement with comprehensive evaluation metrics.

## Target Outcomes
1. **PoT (Proof of Technology)**: Demonstrate basic evolutionary loop with functional correctness
2. **PoC (Proof of Concept)**: Integrate claude-code with task completeness evaluation
3. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Full devcontainer environment with comprehensive code quality metrics

## Success Metrics
- Evolution cycles improve code quality over generations
- Multi-stage evaluation pipeline operational
- Integration with modern development workflows
- Measurable improvement in code correctness, completeness, and quality

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (PoT): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2 (PoC): 3-4 weeks
- Phase 3 (MVP): 4-6 weeks

## Key Stakeholders
- Development Team
- AI Research Community
