# AgentEvolve Product Context

## Product Definition
AgentEvolve is a research and development framework for evolutionary coding agents that automatically improve software solutions through LLM-driven iteration and multi-dimensional evaluation.

## Target Users
### Primary Users
- **GenAI Researchers**: Investigating evolutionary approaches to code generation
- **Software Developers**: Exploring AI-assisted code improvement tools
- **Enterprise Teams**: Evaluating AI-driven code quality improvement tools

## Core Features

### Phase 1 Features (PoT)
- Basic OpenEvolve integration
- Functional correctness evaluation
- Simple evolutionary loop (10-20 program population)
- Basic algorithmic problem solving (FizzBuzz, sorting)

### Phase 2 Features (PoC)
- Claude-code integration for enhanced generation
- DeepEval framework for task completeness metrics
- Multi-requirement challenge handling
- Evolution tree visualization
- Execution isolation and sandboxing

### Phase 3 Features (MVP)
- Complete devcontainer development environment
- Comprehensive code quality evaluation (linting, security, testing)
- Multi-stage evaluation cascade (functional → completeness → quality)
- MAP-Elites evolutionary algorithm implementation
- Checkpoint/resume functionality
- Configuration management system

## Competitive Landscape
- **OpenEvolve**: Base framework for evolutionary code optimization
- **AlphaEvolve**: Google DeepMind's research system (inspiration)
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-assisted coding (different approach)
- **CodeT5/CodeBERT**: Code understanding and generation models

## Differentiation
- Focus on evolutionary improvement vs. single-shot generation
- Multi-dimensional evaluation pipeline
- Integration with modern development workflows
- Open-source research-focused approach
- Systematic quality improvement through iteration

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks
- LLM token cost scaling with population size
- Evaluation pipeline complexity and reliability
- Integration challenges between components

### Market Risks
- Rapidly evolving AI coding landscape
- Competition from established players
- Adoption barriers for new development workflows

## Success Indicators
